Second project with The Odin Project. A rock paper scissors app that will be played in the console. This is the initial update before I've even started. Will update later once I'm in it.

I changed a lot of my code around after looking at someone else's project. They had a sleeker code and didn't use so many if...else if statements. Essentially that's the biggest change. I also very much see the value of git now since I'd have liked to commit that first draft to github so I could see the changes. I'll be more mindful of it now.
